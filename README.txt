Workgroup 10: Simulation studies to model cognitive reserve. Lower rates of dementia observed among individuals with high versus low education or pre-morbid level of cognitive function form the central evidence for the importance of cognitive reserve. This finding is interpreted as evidence that cognitive reserve staves off the functional consequences of neuropathologic processes related to Alzheimer’s or cerebrovascular disease. This interpretation is often bolstered by the observation that cognitive declines and mortality after diagnosis are typically accelerated among individuals with high initial cognitive reserve, as if there is a non-linear link between the accumulation of brain disease and function. An alternative interpretation of these results is that cognitive reserve results in delayed diagnosis of dementia, without conferring notable functional benefits. If cognitive reserve delayed dementia diagnosis, some individuals with high cognitive reserve would die prior to ever being diagnosed, creating an apparent lower risk of dementia among those individuals. The duration of delay that would be required to account for the observed protective effect of cognitive reserve on dementia diagnosis is unknown but could be estimated using simulation models. Simulations would allow us to flexibly account for mortality rates and model the range of plausible delays. # FH18_Sim_CogResDelayedDx
